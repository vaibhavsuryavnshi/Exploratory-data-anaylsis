# Exploratory data analysis projects on super market sales
end to end project Exploratory Data Analysis 
In this project, I conducted an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) utilizing the powerful Python libraries - Pandas, NumPy, and Seaborn. The primary goal was to gain meaningful insights into the dataset and unravel patterns that could inform decision-making.
some key highlights: Data Loading and Inspection, Data Cleaning, Descriptive Statistics, Data Visualization, Correlation Analysis, Pattern Recognition

Project: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Supermarket Sales

Conducted an EDA project on the "supermarket_sales" dataset using Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. The project involved data cleaning, checking for skewness, and exploring data distributions. Key insights were visualized through heatmaps, scatterplots, and count plots. Additionally, I performed data transformations, such as column renaming and conditional data modifications, to enhance the dataset's usability for analysis.
